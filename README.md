# Robust Grasping on Baxter
##Description
This is a project for EE 106B taken at University of California, Berkeley.
Our members include CJ Geering, Andrew Reardon, and Richard Doan. We train on the predicted labels given to us from simulation and implement machine learning techniques to see how well the learned grasps perform in the real world.
